Append-only build log. One entry per phase.

## Phase A — Scaffold · 2026-08-04

**Done**

- `.gitignore` written and committed as the very first commit, before any file that could hold a
  secret existed.
- Repo structure: `backend/` (config, cache, metrics, logging_setup, main, tests), `data/`,
  `fixtures/`, `docs/`.
- `backend/requirements.txt` (full, includes torch) and `backend/requirements-deploy.txt`
  (explicitly no torch, no open-clip-torch, with a comment saying why).
- `.env.example` listing every key with no values.
- `README.md` with the architecture diagram and clean-clone setup; `CONTRIBUTING.md`; MIT `LICENSE`.
- SQLite schema in `cache.py`: `segment_scores`, `route_cache`, `access_segments`, `meta`.
- `GET /api/health` reporting version, cache stats, `clip_available`, fixture mode, missing keys
  and aggregate counters.
- `PROGRESS.md`, `BLOCKED.md`.
- Privacy-safe `metrics.py` — aggregates plus a daily unique-session count from an in-memory
  digest keyed by a salt generated at process start and never persisted.
- `logging_setup.py` — JSON to stdout with a filter that redacts coordinate/IP/user-agent fields
  as a backstop.

**Verified**

- `pip install -r backend/requirements-deploy.txt` succeeds in a clean venv (Python 3.13).
- In that venv: `importlib.util.find_spec('torch') is None` and `import backend.main` succeeds;
  `clip_available()` returns `False`.
- `git log --diff-filter=A --name-only` contains no `.env`.
- Test suite green with sockets blocked (see the conftest network guard).

**Live API calls used:** 3 total — one keyless reachability probe each to Open-Meteo, Overpass and
GraphHopper (the last returned 401, confirming no key is present). None counted against a service
budget; these predate `fixtures.py`.

**Decisions**

- Python 3.13, not 3.11. It is what is installed here, and it satisfies "3.11+". Consequence:
  `torch==2.5.1` from the spec has no cp313 wheel, so the full requirements pin `torch==2.9.1` and
  `open-clip-torch==2.32.0` (held on the 2.x API). This is a version bump inside the specified
  stack, not a substitution.
- Added `python-dotenv` (not named in the stack list) so `.env` loads without a shell wrapper.
  Reason recorded here per the operating rules. It is 20 KB and has no transitive dependencies.
- Added `pyproject.toml` for pytest/ruff configuration only — no `[project]` or `[build-system]`
  table, because Meander runs from a checkout and is not installed as a package.
- Segment cache keys are grid cells rounded to 4 decimal places (~11 m) rather than raw
  coordinates. Neighbouring requests then share cache entries, and no stored row is attributable
  to a single user's path.
- `Cache.__init__` resolves its path at call time instead of binding `CACHE_DB_PATH` as a default,
  so tests can redirect it.

**Deviations**

- `docs/API.md` deferred to Phase C, when the contract is real rather than aspirational.

**Blockers opened:** BLOCKED.md #1 (no `GRAPHHOPPER_KEY`), #2 (no `MAPILLARY_TOKEN`),
#3 (prototype `Waypoint.dc.html` / `mock-api.js` referenced by HANDOFF.md are not on this machine).
